## How to run the files
All the `.ipynb` files can be viewed in github itself. So you can read the files just by clicking on them.
However, if you want to view/modify it in your local machines, follow the steps below.

### Download Python
Download and install `python` (preferably `python3`) from [here](python.org).  

### Install requirements
After installing python, open up a terminal/cmd and type in
```cmd
pip install jupyter
```
or
```cmd
pip3 install jupyter
```
depending on which version of `python` you want jupyter installed into. `pip` for `python2` and `pip3` for `python3`.

### View the notebooks
Download or clone this repository and open up a terminal inside the downloaded repository and enter the command
```cmd
jupyter notebook
```
It will automatically launch your browser and you can read and view the files from your own system.
